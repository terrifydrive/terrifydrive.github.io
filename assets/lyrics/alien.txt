When I see these strange skylines
I want to find other lives
Maybe this world is not mine?
Not mine! 
I really love this sunshine
I cannot waste any time
The space is high, I will climb
I assure you that I am an alien

Every day I look up at distante heaven
Every day I explore the clouds
How to organize the celestial travel?
How to convince crowds? 
I cannot believe there’s no one there
I'm just listening to my mind
There is real life, but I don’t know where
I am going to find

When I see these strange skylines
I want to find other lives
Maybe this world is not mine?
Not mine! 
I really love this sunshine
I cannot waste any time
The space is high, I will climb
I assure you that I am a real alien

Every morning I go to workshop premise
Every morning I build a ship
I'm a physicist and inventive chemist
I prepare for a trip
I will fly away from this trashy world
But you won't notice cause you’re blind
How to find a main part of a pretty soul
I am going to find

When I see these strange skylines
I want to find other lives
Maybe this world is not mine?
Not mine! 
I really love this sunshine
I cannot waste any time
The space is high, I will climb
I assure I'm an alien

When I see these strange sky lines
I want to find other lives
I assure you that I am a real alien
