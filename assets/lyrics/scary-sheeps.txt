Whether I open my eyes or close them, I see the same
I don't know the truth and cannot understand this thing
What's happened to my own world?
It's real or like a game?
My soul is sold
The mind is destroyed
Is destroyed

Am I asleep?
I hear the creepy bleeps
My thoughts are dispersed
They are to be swept
Am I asleep?
I count scary sheeps
And they want to bite my soul
Am I asleep? 
I hear the creepy bleeps
My thoughts are dispersed 
They are to be swept
Am I asleep?
I count scary sheeps
And they want to bite my soul

I can not figure out what is happening to me there
Why my head is lying on cracked and dusty shelf
Is it a day or dark night? 
It's summer or winter time
The darkness is bright
And I want to fight
With my mind!

Am I asleep?
I hear the creepy bleeps
My thoughts are dispersed
They are to be swept
Am I asleep?
I count scary sheeps
And they want to bite my soul
Am I asleep? 
I hear the creepy bleeps
My thoughts are dispersed 
They are to be swept
Am I asleep?
I count scary sheeps
And they filled all my world

Fight with
With my
Fight with
My mind!

Am I asleep?
Am I asleep?
I count scary sheeps
Am I asleep?
They filled all my world
