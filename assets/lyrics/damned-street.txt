No frame, no claim, no name, no matter
My dark day replays
No way and no better
Too late just stop and wait
I so hate this fool story
Don’t speed, no need
My dear street is worried

We're dying here, spinning like a wheel
Between joy and usual sadness
But we haven’t got any honest voice
And it is our choice
This amazing town has a lazy soul
It is like one concrete wall
This eternal street is a common space
And I will die in this known place

I lose, confuse, no news, no pity
This state holds the gates
I hate this cold city
There are sounds like a squeal
There is no fear, and no glory
Like a weed on the mead 
And my dear street is so worried

We're dying here, spinning like a wheel
Between joy and usual sadness
But we haven’t got any honest voice
And it is our choice
This amazing town has a lazy soul
It is like one concrete wall
This eternal street is a common space
And I will die in this known place

Between joy, between sadness
But it is my choice
It is like one concrete wall
And I will die without a voice
