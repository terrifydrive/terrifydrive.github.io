I close my door
I won’t sleep, no more
One, two, three, four
Bad night! 
There are some ghosts
They request a cost
My soul is lost
Come with us, they invite me

Please, don’t take my mind and don’t touch my body
Let me see a light, I must save this life
How cold it’s tonight, there's a ghostly party
How can I stand this fight? 
Please, don’t take my mind and don’t touch my body
I just wanna find a way out of here
How cold it’s tonight, there's a ghostly party
They are going to deceive me

Let me explain
I don’t want this pain
You are insane
Shadow!
What do you claim? 
I am not a prey
Don’t fly, no play
You are a foe, not a fellow!

Please, don’t take my mind and don’t touch my body
Let me see a light, I must save this life
How cold it’s tonight, there's a ghostly party
How can I stand this fight? 
Please, don’t take my mind and don’t touch my body
I just wanna find a way out of here
How cold it’s tonight, there's a ghostly party
They are going to deceive me

Please, don’t take my mind and don’t touch my body
Let me see a light, I must save this life
How cold it’s tonight, there's a ghostly party
How can I stand this fight? 
Please, don’t take my mind and don’t touch my body
I just wanna find a way out of here
How cold it’s tonight, there's a ghostly party
They are going to deceive me

Don’t take
Don’t kill
How can I survive? 
Don’t take
There’s а ghostly party here
