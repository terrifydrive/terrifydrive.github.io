These laws are waves
They will drive us to the grave
But my soul is saved
I am not a slave
It's like a strife
There is in my back a knife
Keep my life
We all have to be alive
Save your spirit, let's keep your life
It is the main goal, to be alive

This boring walls are awful and great weir
But we are hiding like the shy mice
How many times I've tried to get up here
All of these cherished dreams have their price 
Start my ascent this aim is a major
How to proceed I just want to know
If my free life and mind are in danger
I wanna fully destroy this tv show

These laws are waves
They will drive us to the grave
But my soul is saved
I am not a slave
It's like a strife
There is in my back a knife
Keep my life
We all have to be alive
Save your spirit, let's keep your life
It is the main goal, to be alive

This creepy world shows us a desire
So many lives but you are alone
Many of us don't live, just admire
When we look on the light screen of stupid phone 
All of the family ties don't matter
How to perceive a truth in your pride?
Maybe our lives will be worse or better
I just want know about this and to survive

These laws are waves
They will drive us to the grave
But my soul is saved
I am not a slave
It's like a strife
There is in my back a knife
Keep my life
We all have to be alive
Save your spirit, let's keep your life
It is the main goal, to be alive
