How it is possible to do the first main step
When your sacred dreams every day break on the concrete rocks
I don't know the truth and don't know what will be ahead
But I feel that someone put all my hopes in a box
Can an ordinary kind man become successfull guy?
If I am a visitor here, is it a final mark?
I have got no glory this day, but I just want to try
But they will not let me get up, these bloodthirsty sharks


Do you dare to define my own social status?
I'm not a lean foul swine, open this ragged lattice
Why should I stop when I take a few steps just forward?
If my ship's on the move, I won't swim to the shoreward
Do you dare to define my own social status?
I'm not a lean foul swine, open this ragged lattice
Why should I stop when I take a few steps just forward?
If my ship's on the move, I won't swim to the shoreward

What action should I take in here, if I have no choice?
Maybe to bow my head or to start fighting them?
I've made a decision, you will hear my little voice
You will distinctly know my modest strong name
All the hunted animals can reveal their angry fangs
I will stand my ground until I totally win
I'm not afraid of your blames and stupid corrupt gangs
Yes, my ship fell into your hands, but I keep sailing

I keep my own swim
And I will win
I will win!
