Who is watching me?
What is an horror spree?
You won't get my suffering soul
Definitely disagree
What do you all want?
Here's a crazy world
It's a vague and terrible dark ball
It seems to be fully sold

They're chasing me again
All this thoughts fill my exhausted brain
They're almost catching up
I notice the eyes out of every car
They're chasing me again
And they follow me by ships and by planes
They're almost catching up
It is gonna finish for the new start

I hide in my home
Hope to be there alone
And no one will frighten my spirit
I am a flint, I'm a stone
Who knocks on the door?
Stop this prank, I implore
How he knew my primary secret?
He wants to take my soul

He is right here!
He is right here!

They're chasing me again
All this thoughts fill my exhausted brain
They're almost catching up
I notice the eyes out of every car
They're chasing me again
And they follow me by ships and by planes
They're almost catching up
It is gonna finish for the new start

They're chasing me again
All this thoughts fill my exhausted brain
They're almost catching up
I notice the eyes out of every car
They're chasing me again
And they follow me by ships and by planes
They're almost catching up
It is gonna finish for the new start

They're chasing me again
They're almost catching up
They're chasing me again
They're almost catching up
It is gonna finish for the new start
