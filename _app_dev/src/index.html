поколений, характеризующихся архитектурой, элементной базой и способом применения ЭВМ. первое поколение ЭВМ  (1940-1955) - примитивная архитектура, электронные лампы, программирование в машинном коде для научных  расчетов. второе поколение ЭВМ (с  1955) - транзисторы и запоминающие  устройства на магнитных сердечниках, перфокарты и перфоленты, появление языков программирования. третье поколение ЭВМ (с начала 60-х годов) - разнообразная элементная база, применение спецпроцессоров ввода-вывода, мощные внешние запоминающие устройства, семейства ЭВМ, мультипрограммирование и системы разделения времени. четвертое поколение ЭВМ (с начала 70х годов) - интегральные схемы (БИС), память, измеряемая мегабайтами, сети ЭВМ, интегрированные базы данных. пятое поколение - ЭВМ будущего, основанные  на СБИС и искусственном интеллекте computer graphics computer hardware computer language computer literacy computer mail computer micrographics computer network computer power производительность ЭВМ. параметры  оценки производительности ЭВМ включают тактовую частоту (clock rate)  процессора, время выполнения операции типа сложения, время выполнения  регистровой операции, время обработки эталонных
